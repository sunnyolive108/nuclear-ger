# German Nuclear Energy Revival Initiative: Strategic Analysis & Action Plan

## Situation Analysis
- German nuclear plants are being decommissioned despite public support for nuclear energy
- Current energy policy relies heavily on imported natural gas
- Industrial competitiveness at risk due to high energy costs
- Environmental goals compromised by increased fossil fuel dependence
- Political resistance exists despite economic and environmental benefits

## Core Objectives
1. Organize a conference in Berlin (H1 2025)
2. Build case for nuclear plant restarts
3. Develop timeline for potential restarts:
   - First plant: End of 2026
   - Two additional plants: 2028
4. Create network of German nuclear advocates
